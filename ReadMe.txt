1. How to Run:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
The project uses Pre-Installed python Libraries like Tkinter, csv and datetime so no additional package is required to be installed.
Run the main.py file using the command python main.py.
2. Description:

The Clinical Data Warehouse is a software system designed to manage patient data efficiently. It includes modules for user authentication, patient management, and usage statistics logging. Users can log in based on their roles (e.g., admin, clinician) to perform tasks like adding, retrieving, or removing patient data. The system also logs usage statistics to track user actions.
3. Important Information:

Ensure that the required CSV files (Project_credentials.csv and Project_patient_information.csv) are present in the same directory as the code files.
Users should follow role-based access control when logging in.
Usage statistics are logged for monitoring system usage and user behavior.
